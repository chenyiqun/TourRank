The muscles in our bodies are attached to bones. They help the bones move, much like strings help a puppet move. But muscles can pull in only one direction. They cannot push.Each bone is usually attached to a pair of muscles.ones and muscles work like ropes and levers. The muscles can only pull against the bone not push it. So to bend your arm at the elbow, the \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 bicep pulls the lower arm up. To streighten your arm, the tricep pulls the lower arm back out. the muscles have to work in pairs opposite each other to make movement.", "qid": 141630, "docid": "5098393", "rank": 95, "score": 1.7089598178863525}, {"content": "Answers.
